## Ultra-Sensitive UV Solar Blind Optical Wireless Communications with SiPM

Liu, F., Farmer, J., Schreier, A., Faulkner, G., Chun, H., Matthews, W., Wang, Z., & O'Brien, D. (2023). Ultra-Sensitive UV Solar Blind Optical Wireless Communications with SiPM. Optics Letters, 48(20), 5387–5390. https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.503235

In this Letter, an SiPM with a dedicated cooling system suitable for receiving ultra-low-power solar-blind wavelengths is reported. This is designed to decrease the temperature of the detector from 21{\textdegree}C to --10{\textdegree}C, and the corresponding dark count rate (DCR) is reduced by approximately 10 dB. A 275 nm optical wireless communication (OWC) system is established using on--off-keying (OOK) modulation. Transmission rates ranging from 100 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s are demonstrated with this cooled SiPM. The received power is as low as 30 pW (corresponding to 41.5 photons per bit) at a data rate of 1 Mbit/s and a bit error rate of 2.4 {\texttimes} 10--3.

## Free-Space Optical Communication Link with Liquid Crystal Beam-steering

G. Zhang, A. Schreier, X. Wang, W. Matthews, J. Farmer, G. Faulkner, S. J. Elston, S. M. Morris and D. O'Brien, "Free-Space Optical Communication Link With Liquid Crystal Beam-Steering," in IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol. 35, no. 22, pp. 1199-1202, 15 Nov.15, 2023, doi: 10.1109/LPT.2023.3308774.

In this letter, we present a non-mechanical 2D beam-steering system suitable for optical wireless communication. Steering is achieved using polarization gratings combined with nematic liquid crystal cells operating as voltage-controlled polarization shifters. These steering elements are combined with a holographic diffuser matched to the discrete steering angles of the polarization grating, enabling continuous angular coverage. Beam-steering is also used at the receiver, allowing a large collection area receiver with a relatively narrow field of view to be used. The approach presented here could, in principle, be applied to a broad range of wavelengths (including visible light and near-infrared wavelengths). Furthermore, the technique does not inherently limit the transmission data rate. Besides, it improves the link margin and offers the potential for a bidirectional steered link using the same beam-steering elements. Details of the approach are set out in the paper, followed by experimental results from a 50 Mbit/s optical link operating over one meter. Future directions are then discussed.

## A roadmap for multi-Gigabit to Terabit free space optical communications receivers

Matthews, W., & Collins, S. (2023). A roadmap for multi-Gigabit to Terabit free space optical communications receivers. MDPI Sensors, 23(3)(1101), 1–22. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23031101

Silicon photomultiplier's relatively large area and ability to detect single photons makes them attractive as receivers for optical wireless communications. In this paper the relative importance of the non-linearity and the width of the SiPMs fast output on their performance in receivers are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Using these results the performance of receivers containing different SiPMs is estimated. This is followed by discussion of the potential performance of arrays of existing SiPMs. Finally, the possible dramatic improvements in performance that could be achieved by using two stacked integrated circuits is highlighted.

## An Experimental and Numerical Study of the Impact of Ambient Light on SiPMs as VLC Receivers
Matthews, W., & Collins, S. (2022). An experimental and numerical study of the impact of ambient light of SiPMs in VLC receivers. MDPI Photonics, 9(12)(888), 1–17. https://doi.org/10.3390/photonics9120888

Silicon photomultiplier's relatively large area and ability to detect single photons makes them attractive as receivers for visible light communications. However, their non-linear response has a negative impact on the receiver performance, including making them particularly sensitive to am- bient light. Experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have been used to study this non-linearity. The resulting detailed understanding of the origins of the non-linear response leads to concerns over the accuracy of some previous simulations of SiPMs. In addition, it leads to simple methods to de- termine the maximum rate at which a SiPM can count photons and of determining the impact of a SiPMs non-linearity on its performance of a receiver. Finally, a method of determining which filters should be used to protect a SiPM from ambient light is proposed.

## The negative impact of anode resistance on SiPMs as VLC receivers
Matthews, W., & Collins, S. (2022). The negative impact of anode resistance on SiPMs as VLC receivers. In 2022 17th Conference on Ph.D Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME) (pp. 41–44). https://doi.org/10.1109/PRIME55000.2022.9816749

The process used to detect individual photons in passively quenched Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) creates a nonlinear response. A model is presented to show this nonlinearity is an unavoidable consequence of microcells recharging after a detection. However, results are presented which show the nonlinearity is increased by the inclusion of an anode readout resistor. Removal of this resistor improves ambient light performance of communication links by a factor of 1.9 under 300 mWm$^{−2}$ of total 405 nm irradiance.

## DCO-OFDM Channel Sounding with a SiPM Receiver

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a popular modulation scheme, which requires a linear channel. Unfortunately, the most sensitive receivers for visible light communications, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), have a non-linear response. Despite this incompatibility, results from an easily implemented method of combining OFDM and SiPMs are shown to successfully limit the bit error rate to below the limit required by forward error correction.

## Giga-Bit Transmission Between an Eye-Safe Transmitter and Wide Field-of-View SiPM Receiver
Ali, W., Faulkner, G., Ahmed, Z., Matthews, W., & Collins, S. (2021). Giga-Bit Transmission Between an Eye-Safe Transmitter and Wide Field-of-View SiPM Receiver. IEEE Access, 9, 154225–154236. https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116704

In this paper, the performance of a wide field of view VLC receiver that includes a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is reported. In particular, a receiver field of view of ±45° and On-Off keying data rates of 1.8 Gbps are demonstrated in 500 lux of ambient light. These results are achieved by combining optical absorption filters with a 6 mm by 6 mm SiPM. By absorbing ambient light between 450 nm and 750 nm these filters ensure that the SiPM is not saturated and reduces the transmitter power needed to support the required data rate. Unlike other optical filters the performance of absorption filters is not sensitive to angle of incidence. Consequently, the FOV is explained by a combination of the changes to the receiver’s projected area, the path length of light in the filters and reflections from the filter surfaces. In addition, the results of the calculations, described by the IEC 62471:2006 safety standard, needed to determine the eye safety of a transmitter are reported. These calculations and the resulting irradiance levels available in a representative office scenario are used to show that data rates of more than 1 Gbps could be achieved with eye safe transmitters.

## The Impact of the Length of Fluorescent Fiber Concentrators on the Performance of VLC Receivers
Ali, W., Ahmed, Z., Matthews, W., & Collins, S. (2021). The Impact of the Length of Fluorescent Fiber Concentrators on the Performance of VLC Receivers. IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 33(24), 1451–1454. https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2021.3115965

Fluorophore doped plastic optical fibers can be used to create optical concentrators in receivers for visible light communications, that also act as wide field of view filters. Increasing the length of these fibers allows them to collect more of the signal from the transmitter, however, it can also reduce the bandwidth of the fiber. Results are presented from 3 different lengths of fiber which show that the best length of a fluorescent fiber depends upon the data rate. However, a simple calculation results in a length that is a good choice for a range of OOK data rates.

## A 3.45 Gigabits/s SiPM-Based OOK VLC Receiver

A relationship between irradiance and the current needed to maintain the bias voltage applied to a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is shown to agree with experimental data. In addition to showing the saturation of the SiPMs response this relationship can be used to determine the power consumed by an SiPM. In addition, results are presented which show that, because of its higher maximum photon count rate, a 30020 SiPM can achieve a bit error rate (BER) of 10-3 at a data rate of 3.45 Gbits/s.

During these investigations a new form of inter-symbol interference (ISI) was discovered, which can be attributed to saturation of the SiPM.

## Silicon photomultiplier receivers and future VLC systems

The performance of a Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) receiver when used with a 405 nm transmitter is discussed. A comparison of the irradiance available from a low-power transmitter that covers 20 m2 and the performance of the SiPM shows that in an indoor application this combination of transmitter and receiver can support OOK data rates of 1 Gbps. A comparison of the performance of the SiPM and an OEIC highlights the benefits that arise from the relatively large area of the SiPMs. Finally, the potential impact of using SiPMs on future VLC systems is discussed.

## Silicon Photomultipliers as Optical Wireless Receivers in Ambient Light
### Characterisation, Modelling, Monte-Carlo Simulation, and Mitigation of Ambient Light
Matthews, W. (2021). Silicon Photomultipliers as Optical Wireless Receivers in Ambient Light. DPhil Thesis, University of Oxford.

Existing RF wireless communications systems are increasingly struggling to guarantee the quality of service expected by users, especially in environments with many terminals.
Visible light communication (VLC) systems are consequently being considered as a solution to this problem, as they offer the potential for densely packing channels in space and do not contribute to RF congestion.
Receivers based upon silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) have been shown to be more sensitive than other VLC receivers, for on-off keying (OOK) data rates less than 1.5 Gbps.
Despite having the ability to detect individual photons, one of the major issues in using a SiPM as a receiver is device saturation.
SiPM saturation may begin at low irradiances (starting at 10 mW/m2 at 405 nm for a J-Series 30020 SiPM), which may be from either a transmitter or ambient light.

In this thesis, two off the shelf SiPMs are investigated as an OOK VLC receiver these are both characterised and compared in their operating performance.
A robust optical communications system using a SiPM as a receiver, operating at 405 nm in eye-safe irradiances is described.
The highest performing SiPM of the two is further pushed to operate in hostile environments with high ambient light levels.
An alternative evaluation board is utilised to achieve a higher maximum count rate and probe SiPM saturation to understand the mechanisms at work.

The results from characterisation and operation in hostile environments is used to develop and validate an accurate Monte Carlo simulation of SiPMs, and the time domain non-linearity is explained as a consequence of the time taken to recharge a microcell.
The simulation is used to 'look inside' the SiPM and examine typically unobservable parameters, and work is done to quantify the statistical process behind the distribution of time since detection.
This Monte Carlo simulation is the first of its class that has been validated against experimental data.

Additionally, a new form of form of nonlinear inter-symbol interference (ISI) is presented, which occurs when a SiPM operates in ambient light causing time domain non-linearity.
This is achieved through understanding the key mechanisms at play when ambient light illuminates a SiPM, and designing a new receiver that combines multiple SiPMs together to improve the system's ambient light performance as predicted by Poisson statistics.

Finally, a novel receiver is presented which allows for field of view selection in solid state.
This receiver allows for reducing the impact of ambient light from a large field of regard, and the selection of transmitters.

## Graph Modulation
### A Pathway to Ultra-Efficient Communication and Storage for 6G Systems
Matthews, W (2019). Graph Modulation: A Pathway to Ultra-Efficient Communication and Storage for 6G Systems. 4th Year Project, University of Oxford.

High-dimensional communications holds the potential to provide a high-throughput scheme which has a rate that scales super-linearly (considering bits per symbol).
To benefit from the super-linear growth and obtain high data rates, combinatorics and more abstract methods need to be considered to obtain the extra bits of information.
The key benefit of a super-linearly scaling scheme is once the scheme is known the solution to gaining a faster rate is merely achieved by increasing the number of channels.
The primary focus of this work is displaying how the rate of a scheme’s capacity grows as the number of resources increase.
Research showed that schemes exist which offer O(n log(n)) type growth, but nothing was found to offer O(n1+\epsilon) growth for some positive quantity \epsilon.
Here, work is done to explore the super-linear growth rate problem, and a contender for poly- nomial capacity growth, O(n1+\epsilon) is found.
This attempt at an original pathway to such a scheme is found through The Graph Modulation, by looking at the communications problem by considering the mathematical object of the graph.
Various methods are employed to attempt to solve the problem, but no ideal solution was found.
Permutation Modulation, the first scheme to achieve super-linear growth (giving O(n log(n))), is benchmarked against a high lower bound for its space usage.
Results showed that despite permutation modulation’s non-optimal space usage, the rank decoder offers significant benefits in terms of decoding computation requirements and gives a practical solution to implementing permutation when n is driven to a large value.
Finally, the high lower bound used to analyse permutation modulation was found through an original codebook generator made specifically for this work, to space points evenly on a high-dimensional sphere.
A codebook generator is constructed as the Thomson Modulation, which aims to use the available space within the power limits of a transmitter in an optimal manner by aiming for maximum minimum distance properties to be achieved.
Results showed that the constructed codebook generator achieved better distance properties than QAM and was validated as a high lower bound for space usage.
