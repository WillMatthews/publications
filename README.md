# Publications

My name is William Matthews, and I have completed a DPhil in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford.
This repository contains a list of my publications, as well as the PDFs of the papers themselves.

The subject matter of my research is in the field of photonics, specifically in the area of optical wireless communications.
I focused on using Silicon Photomultipilers (SiPMs) as optical receivers for visible light communications (VLC).

See the list [here](https://github.com/WillMatthews/publications/blob/master/publications.md).

You can track statistics for my publications on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7HfJ0lIAAAAJ&hl=en).
You can also find me on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Matthews12) where I upload my research and data where appropriate.
Additionally, I have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2388-4369) which tracks my publications and provides a unique identifier for me as a researcher.
