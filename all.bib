In this paper the relative importance of the non-linearity and the width of the SiPMs fast output on their performance in receivers are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Using these results the performance of receivers containing different SiPMs is estimated. This is followed by discussion of the potential performance of arrays of existing SiPMs. Finally, the possible dramatic improvements in performance that could be achieved by using two stacked integrated circuits is highlighted.},  keywords={Visible Light Communications, SiPM, Monte Carlo},  doi={10.3390/s23031101},  ISSN={1424-8220},  month={Jan}, pdf={sipm-roadmap.pdf}}

However, their non-linear response has a negative impact on the receiver performance, including making them particularly sensitive to am- bient light. Experiments and Monte Carlo simulations have been used to study this non-linearity. The resulting detailed understanding of the origins of the non-linear response leads to concerns over the accuracy of some previous simulations of SiPMs. In addition, it leads to simple methods to de- termine the maximum rate at which a SiPM can count photons and of determining the impact of a SiPMs non-linearity on its performance of a receiver. Finally, a method of determining which filters should be used to protect a SiPM from ambient light is proposed.},  keywords={Visible Light Communications, SiPM, Monte Carlo},  doi={10.3390/photonics9120888},  ISSN={2304-6732},  month={Oct}, pdf={simulation.pdf}}

Increasing the length of these fibers allows them to collect more of the signal from the transmitter, however, it can also reduce the bandwidth of the fiber. Results are presented from 3 different lengths of fiber which show that the best length of a fluorescent fiber depends upon the data rate. However, a simple calculation results in a length that is a good choice for a range of OOK data rates.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/LPT.2021.3115965},  ISSN={1941-0174},  month={Dec}, pdf={fiber-concentrator.pdf}}

@ARTICLE{6,  author={Ali, Wajahat and Faulkner, Grahame and Ahmed, Zubair and Matthews, William and Collins, Steve},  journal={IEEE Access},   title={Giga-Bit Transmission Between an Eye-Safe Transmitter and Wide Field-of-View SiPM Receiver},   year={2021},  volume={9},  number={},  pages={154225-154236},  abstract={In this paper, the performance of a wide field of view VLC receiver that includes a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) is reported. In particular, a receiver field of view of ±45° and On-Off keying data rates of 1.8 Gbps are demonstrated in 500 lux of ambient light. These results are achieved by combining optical absorption filters with a 6 mm by 6 mm SiPM. By absorbing ambient light between 450 nm and 750 nm these filters ensure that the SiPM is not saturated and reduces the transmitter power needed to support the required data rate. Unlike other optical filters the performance of absorption filters is not sensitive to angle of incidence. Consequently, the FOV is explained by a combination of the changes to the receiver’s projected area, the path length of light in the filters and reflections from the filter surfaces. In addition, the results of the calculations, described by the IEC 62471:2006 safety standard, needed to determine the eye safety of a transmitter are reported. These calculations and the resulting irradiance levels available in a representative office scenario are used to show that data rates of more than 1 Gbps could be achieved with eye safe transmitters.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116704},  ISSN={2169-3536},  month={Sep.}, pdf={Giga-bit-transmission-eye-safe.pdf}}
